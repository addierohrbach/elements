</div>

<section class="content">
  <h3>Block:</h3>
    <p>Positioning content using the "block" value adds an element on a new line, stacking
    one on top of another. It also will occupy the available width. Block-level elements can
    be nesting inside each other or wrap inline-level elements.</p>
    <p>Block-level elements are most commonly used for larger pieces of content (ex:
    paragraphs, etc).</p>
    <p>For example: headings and paragraphs are block-level elements because they take up
    the whole width of the page and move the next element below them.</p>
    <section class="block-ex">This is a heading.</section>
    <section class="block-ex">This is a paragraph.</section>
  <h3>Inline:</h3>
    <p>Positioning content using the "inline" value will cause the elements to line up one
    after the other, and only maintin the width of their content. They can be nested inside
    each other, but cannot wrap block-level elements.</p>
    <p>Inline-level elements are most commonly used for smaller pieces of content (ex: few
    world, small images, etc).</p>
    <p>For example: <br>The <strong>"bold"</strong> and <em>"italicize"</em> elements are inline-level
    elements because they fall into the normal flow of the document.</p>
  <h3>Inline Block:</h3>
    <p>Positioning content using the "inline-block" value is helpful when trying to lay out
    pages or place elements next to one another within a line.</p>
    <p>This value will display elements within a line while allowing them to still retain
    all properties (ex: height, width, margin, etc).</p>
    <section class="block">Block 1</section>
